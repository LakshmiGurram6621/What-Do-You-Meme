I’m Lakshmi Gurram, I’ve done my undergrad in Information Technology, as part of the curriculum I’ve taken C, Java, Oracle and HTML courses. After graduation, I’ve worked for around 3.5 years as a Software Developer in Tata Consultancy Services. For the 1st year mostly I’ve involved in maintenance activities, in one word it's a mechanical work like generating weekly/monthly reports, resolving issues without missing SLA, answering customer calls....., after that, I’ve moved to a small java project which is having 3 months lifetime. Finally, I’ve moved to front end development where we have to enhance the webpages based on the requirements and adding accessibility features to every component on the web page, while working there I’ve realized of my technology passion and I’ve landed here.

While going through this course I want to brush up my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge and put my knowledge practically and implement a project so that I can project it in my resume because most of the companies are asking to share the GIT URL even though I’m having work experience I don’t have one to share it. So, at the end of the course, my goal is to get a good development experience and if possible I want to add data analytics features to that app (for example, In case of fitness tracker, if there is a new user and he is looking for the ways to reduce weight I want to provide suggestions based on the existing data, here I’m not sure whether it will be going to be complicated or not, I want to take your help and explore it.
